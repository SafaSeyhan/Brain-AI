Project Overview:
The Brain-AI project focuses on developing AI models that mimic the structure and functionality of the human brain. By leveraging neural networks, cognitive architectures, and neuroscience principles, this project aims to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence.


Key areas of focus include:
Neural network simulations
Cognitive modeling
Brain-computer interfaces
AI-driven neuroscience research


Features:
Neural Network Simulations: Implementations of brain-inspired neural networks.
Cognitive Models: Tools to simulate human-like decision-making and learning.
Datasets: Curated datasets for training and testing AI models.
Visualization Tools: Utilities to visualize neural activity and model performance.
Modular Design: Easily extendable and customizable components.


Installation:
To get started with the Brain-AI project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/SafaSeyhan/Brain-AI.git
cd Brain-AI

Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the demo scripts:
python demo.py


Usage:
Once installed, you can explore the project by running the provided scripts or experimenting with the modules. Here are some examples:


Train a neural network:
python
Copy
from brain_ai.models import NeuralNetwork
model = NeuralNetwork()
model.train(data)
Visualize neural activity:
python
Copy
from brain_ai.visualization import plot_activity
plot_activity(activity_data)
For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation (if available) or explore the codebase.
